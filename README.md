# InfoGAN Implementation

The following is an implementation of [InfoGAN: Interpretable Representation Learning by Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03657) (Xi Chen, Yan Duan, Rein Houthooft, John Schulman, Ilya Sutskever, Pieter Abbeel (2016)). 

The code for the main GAN network (before InfoGAN adaptation) is based off of an implementation by [generative-adversarial-networks](https://github.com/jonbruner/generative-adversarial-networks) by Jon Bruner and Adit Deshpande.
